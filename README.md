# tree-velocity

A collection of sub-projects related to benchmarking tree traversals and 
performing tree traversals on packed representations.  Here's what the main 
subdirectories are for:

 * `BintreeBench` - the tiniest binary tree microbenchmark, implemented several different ways.

 * `ASTBenchmarks` - benchmark of treewalks (compiler passes) on ASTs.
   Also includes scripts to fetch input datasets.

 * `PackedTreesFormal` - a small core language on which we can
   formalize the translation between programs on unpacked and packed
   trees.
   
 * `core-harvest` - harvest realistic, large program ASTs from the wild.
 
 * `./paper` - draft paper
