# Benchmarks for "Infinite" buffers

Instead of allocating a huge 4GB region, the compiler uses a linked list of small regions
which are allocated as required. The size of the region is doubled at every allocation
and remains constant after it reaches a certain limit.

The benchmark uses `buildTree` to construct a tree of depth `n`, and then runs `sumTree` on it.
The size of the first region was 64 KB and the upper bound was 2GB (configured via `rts.h`).
Only 1 benchmark, `buildTree(27)` hit that limit.


* `infinite.c` - Uses infinite buffers

* `infinite2.c` - Same as `infinite.c` except for minor changes. In particular, the region variables are passed
as a separate struct `RegionTy`.

* `buildtree.c` - Uses a single 4GB buffer


## Results

    $ make
    $ ./infinite.exe DEPTH bench  -- criterion-interactive mode
    $ ./infinite.exe DEPTH debug  -- just run it once


    $ ./buildtree.exe DEPTH 1     -- benchmark mode


The executable was generated without any optimization flags (i.e `-O1`).

The timing information for `buildTree` doesn't include the time required for allocating the 4 GB region.
It eventually leads to a segfault on `tank`. To be consistent, it is not measured in the "infinite" version as well.
