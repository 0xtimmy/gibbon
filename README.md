# tree-velocity

A collection of sub-projects related to benchmarking tree traversals and 
performing tree traversals on packed representations.  Here's what the main 
subdirectories are for:

 * `BintreeBench` - the tiniest binary tree microbenchmark, implemented several different ways.

 * `PackedTreesFormal` - a small core language on which we can formalize the translation between programs on unpacked and packed trees.
 * `TinyCore` - stripped down GHC core as a candidate for AST traversal benchmarks
 
 * `./paper` - draft paper
